# Cifar-10
Object Recognition Project


Self Project ! 

  Objective
 • To create  deep learning  models  for object  classification (10 categories) up to maximum accuracy 

 Work	
• Using  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built  regularized  models  to classify objects accurately
• Used CIFAR-10 data set and built models using Keras with Tensorflow backend and other libraries
• Trained the models after various data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy on the models 


Achievement	
• Successfully created the models and achieved maximum accuracy greater than 90% on the test set

# Cifar-10
Object Recognition Project


Self Project ! 

  Objective
 • To create a probabilistic model for object  recognition (10 categories) up to maximum accuracy

 Work	
•	Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built a model to classify objects with regularization  
•	Using CIFAR-10 data set and built model using Keras with Tensorflow backend and other libraries.
•	Trained the model after various data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy on the model


Achievement	
• Successfully created the model and achieved an accuracy greater than 90% on the test set
